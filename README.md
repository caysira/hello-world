hello-world
===========

My General storage for ideas, code snippets etc.

I am a hobbyist maker and love to tinker and work on small electronics projects and hacks on various platforms - from Arduino over PicAxe and STM32 to Raspberry Pi.

I want to keep my ideas and projects here on github to keep them organized and also share them publicly - as I myself drew already a lot of benefit from projects, code and libraries on github, and maybe now I can give something useful back to others.
